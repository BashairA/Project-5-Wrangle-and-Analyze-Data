# Project-5-Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
This is an assignment by Udacity. Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, we will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats,
assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. We will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook,
plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).
